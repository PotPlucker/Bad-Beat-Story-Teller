Creating Texas Holdem hand saving app similar to Share My Pair but specific to Steemit community 
I think entering hand at ShareMyPair is a bit cumbersom. Would be great to be able to enter it in easily via hand history text or a quick graphical system. If this could be done in a way that can earn Steemit rewards that would be a great for authors and curators.
